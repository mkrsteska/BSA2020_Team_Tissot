@JetBlue why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight?,0
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather,0
@united and waiting,0
@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?,0
@JetBlue I'm sick of y'all.,0
@USAirways thank you for leaving my 74 y/o grandma stranded because connecting flt could not wait 10 minutes. I will never fly you again,0
"@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good",0
"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would",0
"@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!",0
"@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!",0
@SouthwestAir yes but not with out an attitude and nasty comment,0
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?,0
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.,0
@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.,0
@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?,0
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.,0
@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR _Ù Ð,0
@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.,0
"@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.",0
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!,0
"@USAirways what does ""your reservation is 'out of sync.'"" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up",0
@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS,0
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund,0
"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.",0
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...,0
@USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious,0
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a,0
@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy,0
"@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest",0
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.,0
@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies,0
@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.,0
@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?,0
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled my flight then put me on a flight the next day.I need help from somebody other than a robot. PLEASE!!! Much appreciated,0
"@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks.",0
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR,0
@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?,0
@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!,0
"@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI.",0
"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)",0
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh,0
@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.,0
@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?,0
"@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.",0
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July,0
@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure,0
@JetBlue does not fit in 140,0
@SouthwestAir How many trees have to die before you stop trying to sell us a credit  card? #OptOut http://t.co/CXrZhcdTVz,0
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous,0
@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting,0
@SouthwestAir I just sent it over,0
@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.,0
@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.,0
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!,0
@USAirways HELLO?! It's been FOUR HOURS since plane landed!   Flt 630 phx to JFK.  3 hrs on Tarmac waiting 4 gate. Plus an hour no bags yet,0
"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.",0
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.,0
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???,0
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline,0
@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!,0
@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?,0
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled,0
"@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff.",0
@USAirways hour 4 at the gate.,0
@usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetwayÛÓwhy not just put thru baggage claim?,0
@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?,0
"@USAirways Its not just PHL, at BTV today made to deplane because ""it's Sunday and we don't know if maintenance will be available""",0
@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!,0
@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.,0
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.,0
"@SouthwestAir love how ""friendly"" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes",0
@united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet,0
@USAirways Has the most useless &amp; Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! _Ù÷_,0
"@united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age...",0
@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.,0
"@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.",0
@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!,0
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.,0
@USAirways not happy!! Trying to get home on Cancelled Flighted flight&amp; been on hold for 2 hours. Help!! This is just crazy...,0
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling,0
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.,0
"@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.",0
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!,0
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation,0
@SouthwestAir  no such thing as a free flight. Gonna be spending $100 on board rental bc #swa couldn't get my baggage to greenville w me.,0
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.,0
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored,0
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!,0
@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service,0
@SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?,0
"@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.",0
@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.,0
.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.,0
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service,0
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago,0
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that,0
@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service,0
"@USAirways Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn't get dividend miles credited.",0
@USAirways can you please post wait time-have been on hold for two hours,0
"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting",0
@JetBlue you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue,0
@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr,0
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor,0
"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.",0
@SouthwestAir  at fort launder dale and the gate agent can't switch flights to an earlier flight but we can on our phone...ridiculous,0
@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance,0
@SouthwestAir it's the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!!,0
"@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport",0
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?,0
@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...,0
"@USAirways call dropped &amp; no call back...another 45min-hour for another rep. The worst CS ever, online, by phone &amp; in person.",0
@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup,0
@AmericanAir IÛªll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks.,0
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.,0
@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj,0
"@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a ""sorry for your inconvenience"" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed",0
@JetBlue PR-friendly tweets don't help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note.,0
@united IÛªve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?,0
@SouthwestAir @poisonpill76 im in same boat.. 8am flight to Jacksonville... Get me out of here!!,0
"@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!",0
@AmericanAir ThatÛªs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesnÛªt understand e-mail 101.,0
@united customer service _ÙÔ_,0
"@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?",0
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.,0
@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.,0
"@USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP",0
@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx,0
"@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer.",0
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable,0
"@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW.",0
"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach",0
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous,0
"@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!",0
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.,0
@USAirways @PHLAirport can you pm me w answer if flt to 4278 is still on time. Been on ground over an hr w no gate. Need help. Pls,0
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?,0
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first,0
@JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?,0
"@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever.",0
@USAirways @Truthh4 they didn't give you the wifi password? Smh,0
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.,0
@united meant changed planes - i hate seating over wing if u wanted I would have booked it - u will get formal complaint,0
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??,0
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail,0
"@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability",0
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.,0
@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed,0
@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service,0
@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.,0
@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF,0
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice,0
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.,0
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.,0
@USAirways ...be found when he checks in. Now no info. Please DM me and help me fix this NOW. (3/3),0

@VirginAmerica I'm pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn't work on iPhone or iPad.don't have a computer #help,0
"@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE.",0
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS,0
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?,0
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket,0
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice,0
"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,",0
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?,0
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.,0
"@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.",0
"@united I know. IÛªm sure you hear it all the time ÛÓ donÛªt like the new seats. IÛªm a small guy, 5Ûª 6Û and I feel the new planes are tight",0
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???,0
@USAirways been on hold way to long!  Is this the best level of service you can provide? - one hour+ is too long!,0
@AmericanAir you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets,0
@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.,0
@USAirways @SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours,0
@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.,0
@united yes I have,0
@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week,0
@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?,0
@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.,0
"@SouthwestAir I thank you for the reply but too complicated to DM, really would like to talk to a cust rep. What is going on there?",0
@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE,0
@JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.,0
@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever,0
@USAirways If my flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled every week I might as well be in business class.,0
@JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies,0
@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways,0
@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol,0
"@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy",0
@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel,0
@USAirways I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in.,0
@SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.,0
@united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me,0
@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA,0
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me,0
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.,0
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.,0
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks,0
@SouthwestAir just sent it,0
@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help,0
"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm.",0
@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail,0
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR,0
@VirginAmerica hi! i'm so excited about your $99 LGA-&gt;DAL deal- but i've been trying 2 book since last week &amp; the page never loads. thx!,0
"@united âÂ202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?",0
@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.,0
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?,0
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. _Ù÷Õ,0
"@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure",0
@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.,0
@USAirways @AmericanAir we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now?,0
@united service staff to is less than friendly!,0
@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?,0
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!,0
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.,0

@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating,0
"It's on me, @JetBlue! That's not what you said last night, though... :(",0
@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply,0
@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.,0
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever,0

@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.,0
@AmericanAir man we have been sitting in #UA4753 on the tarmac for 30 mins...rescue us please!,0
@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.,0
"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow""",0

@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.,0
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again,0
"@AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru",0

"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice",0
@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes,0

@JetBlue it says it is now 9:58 you owe me,0
@SouthwestAir #flight #Cancelled Flightled...tried to get refund but on hold. Can I get it after my flight would have departed?,0

"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?",0
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.,0
@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.,0

@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!,0
@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.,0
.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight,0
@USAirways made it to the Bahamas for work but my luggage didn't. I know #travel happens but is there anyway I can get more help/info?,0
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta,0
"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your siteÛÓit's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness.",0
@USAirways but my bag is still missing,0
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.,0
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS,0
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.,0
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate,0
"@SouthwestAir Thanks for not telling us our flight was Cancelled Flightled, not helping us in anyway and ruining my birthday. #worstcustomerservice",0
"@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.",0

@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?,0
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me,0
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card,0
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?,0
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.,0
@AmericanAir the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.,0

@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.,0
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?,0
@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag,0
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice,0
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it,0
