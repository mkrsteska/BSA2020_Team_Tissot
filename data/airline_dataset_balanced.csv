@JetBlue and stranded passengers aren't being helped to get another flight?,0
"@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.",0

@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?,0
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE,0
"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.",0
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early,0

"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us.",0

@SouthwestAir Had to pay a $25 fare difference on a change but can't seem to find the receipt for it. How can I get a copy for reimbursement,0
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.,0

"@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags",0
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted,0

@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.,0
@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.,0
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.,0
@AmericanAir narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!,0
@AmericanAir I get &amp; can appreciate that. I've just had so many problems in the last year flying with guys... Pretty aggravating.,0
@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N,0

@VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry,0
"@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here.",0
@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss,0
"@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on",0
@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!,0

@SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday.,0
@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?,0

@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate,0
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology,0
"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO.",0
@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service,0

@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.,0
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight,0
. @SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it,0
@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.,0

@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!,0

@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw,0
@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.,0
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.,0
"@AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no?",0
"@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?",0
"@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?",0

@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.,0
